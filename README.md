# Compound Eye Classification

This project focuses on the classification of compound eye images using machine learning techniques.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/compound-eye-classification.git
cd compound-eye-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To train the model, run:
```bash
python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset
```



## Model
The model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. Details of the model architecture can be found in `model.py`.

## Results
The results of the model training and evaluation will be saved in the `results/` directory. This includes accuracy, loss plots, and confusion matrices.
